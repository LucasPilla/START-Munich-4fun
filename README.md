# START-Munich-4fun

Project SkinGuard was created during the START Hackathon at TUM on 29-30 November 2025. The challenge was organized by ONE WARE and was all about using the companie’s product OneAI for a specific real world use case (OneAI is a tool, allowing users to easily train powerful machine learning models for image classification purposes).

## 📖 About this project

SkinGuard is a tool for medical screening purposes. The application’s aim is to give its users medical insights about skin irritations, which they usually could only get from a specialized dermatologist. It's core features a Python backend that trains a OneWare based image classification model. 
The application provides a clean interface for users to quickly analyse any skin irritations and get a fast first assessment.

## 🚀 How it works

Users can upload a picture to the application (either by taking a new one with their camera or by uploading one from their gallery). Next, the application analyses the image for them, telling the user if the skin irritation in question is some kind of disease or not. In case of disease, the application classifies the disease, and gives the user some information about its severity, treatment suggestions (only suggesting treatments that require no prescription) and some general tips on how to ease the pain. Additionally, in case of disease, the user can book a doctor’s appointment directly through the application.

## Disclaimer

SkinGuard does not substitute for a doctor’s visit. It was only created to test and demonstrate the power of ONE WARE and OneAI. SkinGuard serves as a helper to get a first opinion an skin irritation for educational purposes.
